<h1>Study-Timer</h1>

<p>Inspired by NaShallery's egg-timer desktop app using Electron's framework, I've made a desktop app that works as a timer for students and to provide them a little companion while they study, Froggy. </p>

<h3>Pre-Designated Timers</h3>

<p>Depending on how you're feeling, there are 3 available modes to choose from to set your study-duration length for:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Quick Review</strong> - 20 min</li>
  <li><strong>In-Depth</strong> - 1 Hour</li>
  <li><strong>LOCK IN!</strong> - 2 Hours</li>
</ul>

<h3>Collapsed View</h3>

<p>Window taking up a little too much screen-space? You can collapse it and leave it off to the side while the timer keeps going! Be careful, Froggy will still be there to keep you company and keep you accountable.</p>

<br>
<h3>Time's up!</h3>

<p>Once the alarm goes off the 'Stop' button appears and you'll be able to stop and reset the timer. Maybe go again for another round if you're up for the challenge.</p>

<h3>Assets</h3>
<p>All images and animations were made by me using Aesprite. Great software to use when designing pixel-art, I highly recommend it!</p>
